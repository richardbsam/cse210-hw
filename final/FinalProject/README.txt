Project: Task Management System

Project Description: 

Many individuals and teams struggle with organizing and managing tasks efficiently. To address this issue,
we will create a Task Management System in C# that utilizes the principles of Programming with Classes,
including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

The Task Management System will allow users to create, assign, prioritize, and track tasks.
Each task will have various properties such as title, description, assignee, due date, and priority. 
The system will support different types of tasks, such as regular tasks, urgent tasks, and recurring tasks.
